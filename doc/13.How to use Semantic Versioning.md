It's important to communicate the extent of changes in a new release of code, because sometimes updates can break code that a package needs. Semantic versioning is  standard that was designed to sove this problem

##### Semver for Publishers

If a project is going to be shared with others, it should start at 1.0.0,

After this, changes should be handled as follows:

CODE STATUS | STAGE | RULE | EXAMPLE #


First Release | New Product | Start with 1.0.1 | 1.0.0
Bug fixes, other minor changes | Patch Release | Increment the third digit | 1.0.1
New Features that don't break existing features | Minor release | Increment the middle digit | 1.1.0
Changes that break backward compatiblity | Major release | Increment the first digit | 2.0.0

##### Semver for Consumers

As a consumer, you can specify which kinds of updates your app can accept in the package.json file
