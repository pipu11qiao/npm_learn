#### How to Uninstall Local Package

To remove a package from your node_modules directory, use: 

**npm install <package> **

> npm uninstall lodash

To remove ite from the dependencies in package.json, you will need to use the save flag:

> npm uninstall --save lodash

Note: if you installed the package as as "devDependency" then **--save** won't remove it from package.json. You have to use --save-dev to uninstall it.

> npm ls 

will show all package in your application


To confirm that npm uninstall worked correctly, find the node_modules directory. Be sure that it no longer contains a directory for the package you uninstalled.
