#### How to Update Local Packages

It's a good practice to periodically update the packages your application depends on. Then, if the original developers have improved their code, your code will be improved as well.

To do this: 

1. run npm undate in the same directory as the package.json file of the application that you want to update.

2. Run npm outdated. There should not be any results.
