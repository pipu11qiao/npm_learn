There are two ways to insall npm packages: locally or globally. Choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want ot use the package.

* if you want to depend on the package from your own module, using something like Node.js' require, then you want to install locally. This is npm install's default behavior.
* if you want to use a package as a command line tool,(such as grunt CLI), then install it globally.

##### Which Version of the Package is installed?

If there is no package.json file in the local derectory, the latest version of the package is installed.

If there is a package.json file, npm installs the latest version that satisfiles the semver rule declared in package.json
